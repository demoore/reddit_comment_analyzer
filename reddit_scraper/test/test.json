She doesn't have critical thinking skills, she doesn't understand the difference between science and magic, and she doesn't possess the cognitive abilities to think abstractly about the possible consequences of her actions. 

There's a very good reason we don't let children make these kinds of life altering decisions, they simply do not have developed enough brains. I'm not presuming this, I know this. ",

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m getting out of your argument is that because feminists have done some bad things in the past we shouldn&amp;#39;t use the label. Additionally, you seem to think that because some feminists  have used non-inclusive definitions of men and women the whole idea that men and women should be treated as equal should be thrown out as an ideal. This seems silly to me, just because there are a few assholes in the movement doesn&amp;#39;t mean we should deem the whole movement as meaningless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also silly to point to the downfalls of past feminists as if that&amp;#39;s a damnation against current feminists. In a good human right&amp;#39;s movement we should expect things to always be getting better. A person could, in theory, hold the belief that the value of person is unrelated to their gender while at the same time being a big old racist. This second, ignorant belief doesn&amp;#39;t invalidate their first good belief. It just means they aren&amp;#39;t a perfect social justice warrior. &lt;/p&gt;

This second, ignorant belief doesn't invalidate their first good belief. It just means they aren't a perfect social justice warrior. ",

In the end you have to ask yourself three things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) What the label actually means&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)What the person using the label thinks it means&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Whether the gender of the person using that label has any bearing on whether or not they&amp;#39;re using it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feminist label by it&amp;#39;s simplest definition just refers to a desire to see men and women treated equally. As long as the man using this label is using it in that sense or a very similar sense I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with it. In fact I would love it if all men and all women were feminists in this sense because then the term would be completely unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kind of understand where your discomfort comes from, not every self identified feminist uses the term correctly. This includes some guys (and gals) who think women should be treated better than men. It&amp;#39;s annoying/offensive when women do this but it&amp;#39;s downright disconcerting when men do it. It seems like they&amp;#39;re making some kind of self-hate statement and that is not something I find particularly attractive in anyone. Could it be that you&amp;#39;ve experienced a few self hating male &amp;quot;feminists&amp;quot; who&amp;#39;ve ruined the term for you?&lt;/p&gt;

For me, finding alternative things to believe in was what gave me a renewed sense of purpose. Not spiritual things obviously, but for instance I started engaging in and learning about a lot more social justice movements than I ever did as a Christian. It gave me new labels to apply to myself, something I think a lot of exchristians kinda miss. When you&amp;#39;re super religious you&amp;#39;re whole identity is defined by your beliefs. Losing your beliefs leaves you feeling like you have no sense of identity. You end up in a position where as an adult you&amp;#39;re suddenly having to reestablish your entire sense of self. It can be a pretty earth shattering experience and it can take a long time to rebuild a sense of self that took decades to create the first time round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if this describes you own experience, everyone&amp;#39;s is different, but my advice would be that you look on this as an opportunity to start over. As an exchristian, you are in a position to explore a whole new range of values, beliefs and other identifiers and decide for yourself which ones are going to be important to you. It&amp;#39;s not exactly a fun experience but it is something we all go through and in the end you&amp;#39;ll probably end up learning a lot of things about yourself that you would never have had the opportunity to learn as a religious person. Good luck and keep your chin up!&lt;/p&gt;

The reality of the situation is vastly more complicated. For instance, while it is true that more men are victims in homicides, a breakdown of the different types of homicide shows that the vast majority of male homicides are drug or gang related. Women actually outweigh men as victims in domestic and sex-related homicides. What this tells us is that it would be better for MRA&amp;#39;s to focus on supporting men involved with drugs and gangs rather than on overall prevalence rates if they actually want to reduce harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my suicide statistic, I&amp;#39;m going to stand by what I said because you have given me no valid reason to believe your claim that women are just doing it for attention. The actual research suggests that women overall simply choose less immediately lethal methods to kill themselves. Less immediately lethal methods mean they are more likely to be caught before death occurs but this does not make these methods less deadly. It&amp;#39;s actually pretty disturbing that you would chalk all these cries for help up to &amp;quot;she just wanted attention.&amp;quot; The Wikipedia page I originally linked to has more information and plausible explanations for these gender differences if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your last point is not actually relevant to this conversation because your anecdotal evidence about what feminists say about their great grandmas doesn&amp;#39;t actually have any bearing on whether or not military deaths make a good case for the non-existence of male privilege. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of OP&amp;#39;s post actually mentions feminists so there is some finger pointing going on. My point is that demonizing feminists does nothing to actually help men. If MRA&amp;#39;s want to actually do some good they need to stop obsessing over what feminists say and do and actually get out there and start saying and doing some stuff of their own. I&amp;#39;m saying this as a feminist who thinks there are areas in which men are at a disadvantage. It frustrates me to no end that a group that has the potential to actually work on improving these issues seems to prefer to spend their time obsessing over what another group does.&lt;/p&gt;

While it&amp;#39;s true that 97% of military deaths are men this is still only 6616 deaths in the US over the last 13 years.

&lt;p&gt;The industrial accidents stat is one area where there may be a case for male discrimination however the solution to this problem is not going to come from pointing the finger at feminists. This problem will only be solved by demanding that companies take greater responsibility for the safety of their workers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stats presented in the infograph have been very carefully picked and do not paint a full picture of reality. It would be very easy to find five random statistics that paint a completely different picture in favour of the idea of male privilege. Cherry-picking data to create the illusion of a world in which men have it much harder than women should not be the goal of this movement.

I&amp;#39;m going to have to disagree. I think one day people will look back on our attitudes towards short shorts and tank tops with the same level of ridicule that we look back on ankle shaming today. It just seems really silly and arbitrary to suggest that some dress codes are unfair while others are reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re talking about teenagers here not little kids, they are old enough to be aware of how they are dressing and take responsibility for any results. Not only have they made it perfectly clear that they are ok with dressing this way but so have their parents by allowing them to leave the house like that. They&amp;#39;re seeing each other naked every day after school anyways so it&amp;#39;s not like we&amp;#39;re protecting their innocence or anything. It seems like we&amp;#39;re sending them a really messed up message of &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not OK to slut shame unless the slut you&amp;#39;re shaming is under 18 years of age and then the school will do it for you.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone else suggested that we&amp;#39;re just trying to train them in how to dress professionally in their future careers. I think that&amp;#39;s bullshit, there are much easier ways to teach teens to dress professionally like for instance taking some time one day to have a lesson on dressing for an interview. Dress codes aren&amp;#39;t about teaching kids anything, they&amp;#39;re about making the school look good. Should we really be forcing teens to dress the way we want them to dress because we&amp;#39;re embarrassed by them? I can remember the dress codes I was forced to adhere to and the only thing it taught me was that some adults had a real stick up their bums about ankle socks and tank tops. At some point we might have to accept the idea that our ideas about modesty and decent apparel might be outdated.  &lt;/p&gt;

While there are a few genuine cases where this is true (men can't give birth, women can't helicopter dick etc.) these are almost exclusively due to physical differences not mental ones. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that women can't succeed in politics. You might not like the label, but the fact of the matter is your opinions are sexist. I would encourage you to have a long hard think about why you believe the things you do and maybe open your mind to the possibility that you're wrong.",

Your beliefs are archaic and not at all based in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for your suggestion that women might vote for a woman just because she&amp;#39;s a woman, you literally started this conversation suggesting that you would only vote for a man. Doesn&amp;#39;t that sound just a little hypocritical to you?&lt;/p&gt;

There is such a thing as having an opinion that is not just different but is in fact wrong. Thinking that women cannot properly run countries because vaginas is actually a wrong opinion that can be proven incorrect by looking at countries that are successfully run by women. Disagreeing with people isn't the same as picking on them.",
